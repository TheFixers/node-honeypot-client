Honeypot Client using NodeJS, NPM, React, Webpack, and custom modules to parse JSON responses from Honeypot Server

## Warning
* DO NOT PULL THIS INTO MASTER UNTIL I AM DONE!!!
* Legacy code has been moved to `legacy/` but links have not been changed yet, so the legacy code is broken for now, but intact.
* Scaffolding and basic app construction for refactor is underway. Please do not touch right now as it's in a critical stage of development, and just being fleshed out right now... Feel free to fire it up though... :)

## This project assumes you have Node and the following global NPM packages installed 
* `node`
* `babel`
* `webpack`
* `webpack-dev-server`

### Example of installing global NPM packages

##Installation

Use the following commands from the root directory...
